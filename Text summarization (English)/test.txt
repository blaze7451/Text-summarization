Cristiano Ronaldo made history on Thursday as he became the first man in history to score in five FIFA World Cups, leading Portugal to a 3-2 victory over Ghana at Stadium 974 in Qatar.

The Portugal captain kickstarted a flurry of goals in the 65th minute when he converted a penalty to put his team ahead 1-0.

The 37-year-old, who is playing in a record-equaling fifth World Cup, remains two goals shy of passing Eusebio (9) to become the nation’s leading goal scorer in tournament history.

Ghana, though, wasted no time in leveling the score as Andre Ayew equalized in the 73th minute.

But Ghana's joy was short lived as Portugal scored two successive goals in just under three minutes through João Félix and Rafael Leão.

Osman Bukari scored a late consolation goal for Ghana in the 89th minute but Portugal held on for the victory.

Ghana's Iñaki Williams nearly provided the ultimate drama in the final minute of the match as he stole the ball from Portugal's goalkeeper after hiding behind him - only to slip at the crucial moment.

Pre-tournament favorite Brazil and Serbia will be the last two teams to get their World Cup tournaments underway when they meet at the Lusail Stadium.

Five-time champion Brazil arguably boasts the best attacking line-up in the tournament, both in terms of quality and depth.

Neymar Jr. – like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – is searching for his first World Cup title, and the Paris Saint-Germain star will be ably supported upfront by Real Madrid’s Vinicius Jr., Barcelona’s Raphinha, and Tottenham Hotspur's Richarlison.

But Serbia, which topped its World Cup qualifying group ahead of Portugal, will be no pushover and has plenty of goalscoring prowess in captain Dušan Tadić, Juventus forward Dušan Vlahović, and Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrović. However, Vlahović and Mitrović have both been nursing injuries ahead of the tournament.

Hoping to reach the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time, Serbia will likely have to battle it out with Switzerland and Cameroon, who face each other on Thursday, to reach the round of 16 -- barring any disastrous results for Brazil.

But as this World Cup has demonstrated so far, don’t rule out any eventuality.
